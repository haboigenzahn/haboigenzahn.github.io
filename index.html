		<h3> Project 1: <a href="https://medium.com/@hayley.boigenzahn/good-design-362116c6e28d" style="color:green">Good Design</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@hayley.boigenzahn/bad-design-e36b15d5c285" style="color:red">Bad Design</a></h3>
		<p>For the first project, I found an example of good and bad design on the WPI campus.</p>
		<p><img src="GoodDesign_1.jpg" style="float:left;width:100px;height:178px"></img>
		As an example of good design, I took pictures of a study room in Goddard Hall. It works well for group meetings and office hours.</p>
		<p><img src="BadDesign_1.jpg" style="float:right;width:178px;height:100px"></img>
		As an example of bad design, I picked the door leading out of the sub-basement of Alden Hall. The door has no path leading out of it, and is the only outdoor access to the floor.</p>
		<p> Additional pictures and information about each design can be found by clicking on the two parts of the title.</p>
		
		<h3 style="margin:15px"> <a href="https://medium.com/@hayley.boigenzahn/design-for-others-83bc76caa766">Project 2: Design for Others </a></h3>
		<p> For the second project, we designed mobile website for the Worcester Public Library directed at churches and religious groups. This was the first project that we developed 
		sketches and preliminary designs for. <img src="DesignForOthers_2.jpeg" style="float:right;width:100px;height:120px"></img></p>
		<p>We also created an idea board for collecting pictures and concepts: <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/6Y3KMG2DBU5/">Mood Board</a></p>
		<p> The project only includes a few of the pages that would exist in a completed website. The final product was put together using InVision, a rapid prototyping tool.</p>
		<p> The final demo can be previewed <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/13759988/286914859/preview">here</a>.</p>

		<h3 style="margin:15px"> <a href="https://medium.com/@hayley.boigenzahn/design-for-understanding-17e78406b29b">Project 3: Design for Understanding </a></h3>
		<p> The third project centered on data visualization. We used data about the spread of infectious diseases in America from the <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/">CORGIS database</a> to create two graphs.
		The first visualization is intended to convey information in the most factual and informative way possible. The second visualization is intended to present information in a way that is memorable and persuasive.</p>
		<p>The technical aspect of this project was difficult because no one in our group was familiar with JavaScript. We had to significantly alter our design plan, which started as a map, so that 
		we could finish the project in time despite the difficulties.</p>

		<img src="DesignForUnderstanding_2.jpeg" style="float:left;width:90px;height:120px"></img>
		<p> Eventually, we generated a frequency chart for the data. We used sliders to control the year for the factual representation, and included extra information about 
		the year that the polio vaccine was introduced for the persuasive representation.</p>
